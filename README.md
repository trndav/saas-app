# SaaS App

This course was outdated so many codes are not working and services that were free before are paid now. Course uses AWS S3, Heroku and gem Milia, in Rails 5 (or 4). I did what I could, but some stuff are skipped so Tenants table does not exist, credit card purchase and switching users paid plan does not work.

* Projects table
* Users table
* Login/logout, create/edit users views
* Artifacts table
